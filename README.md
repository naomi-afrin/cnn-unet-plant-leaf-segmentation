# 🌿 U-Net-Based Plant Leaf Segmentation

This deep learning project leverages a U-Net architecture, built on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to perform **semantic segmentation** on plant leaf images. The model is trained to detect and segment disease-affected areas in leaves using binary masks, enabling pixel-level plant disease localization.
